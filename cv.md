### About Myself:

One of my hobbies has always been web technology. About 15 years ago, I already started learning Frontend and a little Backend. A couple of months ago, I decided to recall a long-forgotten science. I found several courses on the Internet and started studying. But a lot has changed in 15 years. But I decided to go all the way. My choice fell on JavaScript Frontend development.

My strengths are the ability to learn and selfâ€“organization, the ability to find a solution to any problem, teamwork.
